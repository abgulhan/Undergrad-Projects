make sure you have numpy, sklearn and pandas installed for python3.

Run the program using the command:  python3 ./file_final.py <-t or -s>

use -s for predicting test file
use -t for viewing test accuracy (train and test selected randomly so each run has different results)

input file names:  'train.csv' and 'test.csv'
output is made to 'submission.csv'
